The organisers do not check the validity of the rosters, but you may be penalised by lowering the amount of Battle Points awarded for the entry if you need to make any significant changes to your roster after the entry deadline.

**Points system:**
Each team can earn 0 - 100 BP in every round (0 - 20 per player).

A team which earns more than 65 BP in a round gets 65 Match Points. A team which earns less than 35 BP in a round gets 35 Match Points. In other cases the team gets as much Match Points as it has earned Battle Points.

The team ranking is formed based on the Match Points first, then the Battle Points.

**Points per game:**
As in the T9A Rulebook.

**Secondary Objectives:**
As in the official T9A tournament rules for team tournaments.

**Team pairing:**
We guarantee that all guest teams will have opponents in the first round. We will also try to pair the teams in the first round so that teams from the same countries / clubs do not play against each other.

Pairing for the first round will be randomized two days before the tournament and made public. If a team does not manage to show up on the day of the tournament its’ opponent will play with another team chosen by the organiser.

In subsequent rounds the swiss system will be used to determine pairings.

**Pairing players:**
As in the official T9A tournament rules for 5 player team tournaments. Pairing of the players should take no more than 15 minutes.

**Secondary Objectives (as in the table in the Tournament Pack)**

**Round 1**
* Pairings 1-2 Hold the Ground
* Pairings 3-4 Breakthrough
* Pairing 5 Capture the Flags

**Round 2**
* Pairings 1-2 Secure Target
* Pairings 3-4 Hold the Ground
* Pairing 5 Breakthrough

**Round 3**

**Painting and preparation:**

Movement trays are obligatory. They don’t have to be painted or modelled.

Army books are obligatory. They can be printed or on your smartphone / tablet.
At least the team’s captain should have the Rulebook available.
Each player must have a ruler and dice. If you use use magic you should also have magic cards or the list of spells.

Proxies are not allowed. Should you have any doubts if the model will be considered as a proxy feel free to contact us via PM - we will let you know so there are no surprises at the event. Teams caught on using proxies will be penalised.

All models must have proper bases and be complete, i.e. cavalry models should have their riders, etc.

There will be no hobby points given at the event but all models in an army must be painted. Judges will remove any models that are painted with less than three colours and without details.

Sylvan Elves players should have their additional forest made from a durable material and make sure it has a proper size.

Prepaints and toy models will be removed if they do not fit into the look and feel of the rest of the army. Players should have proper models to use with special abilities / spells, etc.

**The captain:**
One team member should be nominated as the captain. Captains will announce all the team’s decisions to the opposing captain. The captain is also responsible for returning the team’s results.

In every battle the player has a right to consult the captain ONCE. During the consultation they can ask for advice on any decision that has to be made in the game. This consultation should not take more than 3 minutes. Other people can not give advice to players.

**The game:**
The game is a duel between the two generals and it is crucial that they are not disturbed by any other people who watch the game. If you are a bystander remember not comment or suggest any decisions made by the players. Players can ask their captains to intervene or to call a judge if there is a problem with any people interrupting the game.

Of course the captain can ask the player what result is probable, or how many victory points the player thinks will earn for the game. This is not considered a consultation with the captain.

**Confirming presence and returning the results:**
The captain should confirm presence of the team to the organisers on the first day of the tournament between 8.00 and 9.00. The registration desk will be closed at 9.00. Teams which will not register by that time are not guaranteed to play the first round. You should take that into consideration when organising your trip to the event.

The captain is responsible for returning the team’s results. Each round takes 3.5 hours from which 15 minutes should be reserved for pairing players. The team which returns results after the deadline will be penalised:
* 0-2 min: 10 PP,
* 2-5 min: 20 PP,
* 5-10 min: 35 PP,
* 10+ min: 35 PP and the teams’ result is set as 0:0

Penalty points will not be taken into account when forming pairing for subsequent rounds. They will deducted from the final results.

**Judges:**
Judges will probably be busy on this event so, even though they are at your full disposal try to settle simple cases with your captains. Remember to ask the judges only if you have a complicated case. If you need to ask for a rule that can be easily found in the Rulebook - to that first. Players who tend to ask the judges for simple clarifications too often can be treated as using stalling and get a penalty.

**Others:**
There is no ban on alcoholic drinks at the venue but we reserve the right to intervene or even ask out any players overusing this liberty. There will be a proper party in the evening so let’s save ourselves for that ;)

Players under eighteen years old should bring the following declaration of liability signed by their parent or legal custodian:

“I hereby let my child to take part in the event the 9th Age Polish Team Championship 2017 on 26-27.08.2017 in Zielona Góra, Poland and agree to take liability for any damages caused by him/her.”

The declaration should be signed by a parent or a legal custodian.

We don’t provide any accommodation, it’s up to you to fix one. Here is a list of different places where you can stay for the night in Zielona Gora: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iBaGc8-HflnR5D28iHy6HYsmDEwOZyTEbCOhkUYrGa4)​
